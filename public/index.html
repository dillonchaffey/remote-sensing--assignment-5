                <p>
                    In this exercise areas which were one through four meter above sea level were highlighted to
                    visualize flooding. Building footprints were extruded to their average height as well to show the
                    impact of the flooding upon them.
                    After the data was downloaded for the study area the DEM rasters were merged in ArcPro. The DEM was
                    then run through the Con tool to create 4 flood rasters, each containing an area that was 1,2,3, and
                    4 meters above sea level.
                    The next step was to extrude the building footprints. The open street map building data had the
                    footprints of the buildings in the area. These building footprints were extruded to the average
                    height of the building footprint area taken from the CHM.
                    The scene was then set changed to a 3D local scene, the four flood interval rasters were then
                    overlaid with the buildings, exported to images and then compiled into the animated GIF you see
                    here. Crossfading between the rasters was done to give a smoother flood like visualization.

                <h1>Part 3: Wind Farm Visualization</h1>
                <p>
                    In this part a wind farm was visualized in Cheticamp, Nova Scotia. Cheticamp is infamous for its
                    high wind speeds and the weather station there has recorded wind speeds of over 200 km/hour on
                    several occasions. The area is also one of the most populated in northern Cape Breton. All in all it
                    is an ideal site for a wind farm.
                    To create this visualization the DEM was added and used as the elevation source for the 3D scene.
                    The 3D wind turbine models were then added to the map and set to the proper height and width
                    dimensions. Once the terrain and models were set up in a 3D scene a series of key frames were added
                    that were smoothly transitioned by ArcPro’s map tool. The exported video can be seen below.

                <p>
                    In this example a park was rendered in the browser using threejs. The elevation data was downloaded
                    from the Nova Scotia Elevation Explorer website and then the sequential tiles for the study area
                    were merged with the Mosaic to New Raster tool. The park concept art was then imported and
                    georeferenced to position it correctly. The merged DEM and the georeferenced park image were then
                    added in QGIS and exported as a 3D scene using the qgis2threejs plugin. The vertical exaggeration
                    was set to 1.5 to more effectively visualize the terrain. The exported 3D render can be viewed in
                    the browser by clicking the link below.
